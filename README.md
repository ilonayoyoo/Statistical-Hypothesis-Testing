Statement of the Problem

Authors (Names and Percentages): Benjamin Tan (100%)

Emergency responders like firefighters are crucial for community safety, yet the demanding nature of their work can lead to chronic stress, impaired decision-making, and poor sleep quality (√Ångel et al., 2022). Improving these aspects could enhance the emergency services, and firefighter‚Äôs well-being, potentially saving more lives. This research aims to provide empirical evidence on mindfulness meditation‚Äôs efficacy in promoting better decision-making under stress and improved sleep quality among firefighters. Many studies have shown mindfulness practices reduce anxiety and depression, and improve concentration and attention (American Psychological Association, 2019), these are crucial for effective decision-making in high-stress situations which are typical for firefighters.

The findings may be able to inform actionable recommendations to the U.S. Fire Administration for integrating mindfulness meditation into routine training and wellness programs of firefighting units. This integration could enhance operational efficiency, firefighters‚Äô well-being, and community safety. Acting as a proactive measure to improve the firefighter‚Äôs resilience and effectiveness amidst their challenging work environment.
Literature Review

Chronic stress significantly impacts decision-making and sleep quality, leading to neural circuitry imbalances that affect cognition, anxiety, mood, and systemic physiology (McEwen, n.d.). Various stressful experiences influence human decision-making beyond the simple fight-or-flight model (Anthony & Mauricio, 2017). Sleep deficiency is linked to learning, focus, reaction issues, and challenges in decision-making, problem-solving, and emotion management (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2022). Such stress inhibits the prefrontal cortex, crucial for planning, evaluation, and emotion regulation, essential for clear decision-making (Abrams, 2022).

Firefighters encounter substantial workload-related stress due to the nature of their job. An empirical study involving 654 firefighters revealed that high workload adversely affects perceived health and performance, while also increasing perceived stress. This workload stress, often exacerbated by the intense and unpredictable nature of firefighting, can significantly impact their mental and physical health (Rusch et al., n.d.). These challenges are compounded by the emotional toll of witnessing traumatic events and balancing work and family life, especially during times of crisis like pandemics (Willing, 2021).

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate these challenges. MBSR, which includes yoga and meditation practices, has been shown to enhance mindfulness, potentially reducing stress and improving sleep quality (Pacheco & Rehman, 2022). In a study of urban firefighters, mindfulness practices were linked to reduced PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and alcohol problems, indicating its effectiveness in addressing the specific mental health challenges faced by firefighters (Mindful, 2023).

While there is evidence supporting the general benefits of mindfulness, more focused research is needed to understand its specific impact on firefighters. The existing studies suggest a promising role for mindfulness in supporting firefighters‚Äô mental health and enhancing their decision-making abilities under stress.

Research Plan
Population of Interest

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (100%)

The population of interest for this study focuses on firefighters across various states in the United States, with the research plan focusing on a randomized sampling method that minimizes bias. Given the challenge of splitting individuals into treatment and control groups within the same firefighting units, especially when they work closely together in the same station that the decision made by one firefighter may have a significant impact on their peers, our study proposes randomization at the firefighting station level. This approach not only considered potential biases due to working relationships among firefighters but also the stations selected for this study were carefully chosen to reflect the diverse geographic locations, sizes, and demographic compositions found across the entire country, ensuring a comprehensive and representative sample that mirrors the national landscape of firefighting stations.


Sample Selection

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (50%), Siyang Yu (50%)

According to the federal data of wildfire statistics and fire report from the National Fire Protection Association (Policygenius, n.d.), we decided to choose fire departments from the top 10 states with the highest number of wildfires per year and highest incidents of residential fires. We ensure to include locations in both urban and rural areas: California, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oklahoma, Oregon, Montana, and Utah. Across all of the states, there is a cumulative number of 27,166 fire stations. Our objective is to filter those that demonstrate a willingness to participate in our research and select 5 fire stations per state that were mentioned earlier, which will be 50 fire stations in total for this study. Within each fire station, we will use simple random sampling and split the control group and treatment group evenly. This method ensures the sample firefighters are selected without bias from different ages, ranks, and appointments.

Inclusion Criteria:
Active duty firefighters with at least one year of service, aged 20-60 in participating departments.

Willingness to participate in the mindfulness meditation program (for the treatment group) and adhere to the research protocols.

No prior consistent practice of mindfulness meditation or other similar mind-body interventions.

Exclusion Criteria:
Firefighters with prior formal training in mindfulness or meditation.

Firefighters with medical conditions or medications that could significantly affect sleep quality or cognitive function.

Any other factors that could confound the outcomes of interest (e.g., shift work sleep disorder, diagnosed sleep disorders).


Operational Procedures

Authors (Names and Percentages): Siyang Yu (60%), Yuxuan Zhao (20%), Benjamin Tan (20%)
We decided to do our study and collect data in winter for several reasons. According to USFA, the seasonal nature of fire is a crucial factor, and the highest incidents occur from late winter till summer for outside, vehicle and structure fire.

Process
An invitation for emergency responders to participate in this study will be sent via email to the emergency management and Human Resources department, with a detailed purpose, process, and potential benefits of this study.

According to ‚ÄúFirefighter Training Feasibility Study‚Äù, the majority of training is offered by OFPC classrooms, so we will continue to train our participants in the classroom. The only difference is that we will give a 40-45 minutes (Mindful Leader, n.d.) mindfulness meditation to the treatment cohort.

After the meditation training in the classroom for 2 months, we will bring them to on-site burn buildings to test our research questions mentioned above. This simulation aims to simulate the daily front-line aid work of firefighters. The whole experiment‚Äôs decision accuracy will be mainly assessed in four dimensions: ‚ÄúFire control‚Äù, ‚ÄúExtrication‚Äô‚Äô,‚Äùtreating the wounded‚Äù and ‚Äúconfirming the cause of the fire‚Äù. Participants will be rated by senior police officers and fire instructors. And the reaction time will be monitored by instructors using a stopwatch.

We will place the experimental operation part of the study in winter. As mentioned in ‚ÄúThe Seasonal Nature of Fires‚Äù, given by the U.S. Fire Administration, winter and festivals are fire-prone periods. We are trying to maximize the nervousness of the participants, and firefighters, and amplify the experimental effect.

Research Study Integrity
To maintain the integrity of the study and ensuring valid results. Minimizing the possibility of firefighters in the control group learning about the mindfulness program is important, especially considering the unique environment in which firefighters operate. The mindfulness meditation would be embedded into the treatment‚Äôs group training. In this discreet integration setup, the mindfulness training would not overtly highlight its presence. The interactions between control and treatment groups will also be watched closely, especially during joint training or firefighting operations, to identify and address any situations where information about the mindfulness program might be inadvertently shared.

Smart Wearable
As defined, a deep-sleep occurs in the third stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. During deep sleep, electrical activity in the brain appears in long, slow waves, having frequency of 0.5 to 2 Hertz, called delta waves (Pacheco & Singh, 2023). In order to increase operability, we will choose a wearable smart bracelet to help detect the time when participating firefighters reach deep-sleep. We define a deep-sleep as time that accounts for 80% or more of the total sleep time. The final statistical deep-sleep percentage will be the total number of deep-sleep times as a percentage of the total number of sleep times.


Brief Schedule

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (100%)
According to scientific research, practicing meditation a day for 45- 60 days will have measurable effects on the brain. Hence our 4-month study will be divided into two main parts: 2 months of meditation training collaborated with professional trainers, and 1 month of live fire training, monitoring, and performance examination.

Phase 1: Planning and preparation (2 weeks, from September 1st, 2024)
Week 1: Conduct research, finalize selection of fire departments participating.
Week 2: Initialise training sessions for researchers, and meditation trainers for cyber security, responsibility, training schedule, and resource allocation to all fire stations.

Phase 2: Sample selection and education training (2 months, mid-September - mid-November, 2024)
Week 3: Selection and recruitment of participating firefighters. Randomly divide samples evenly into two groups.
Week 4 - Week 10: Provide training to treatment group in the classroom. Monitor the regular practice of mindfulness and provide continuous support

Phase 3: Field training, project monitoring, and data collecting (1 month, mid-November - mid-December, 2024)
Week 11: Conduct live fire training drills, both treatment and control groups will participate and enter burning structure carrying fire hose.
Week 14: Collect data on decision-making accuracy, reaction time, sleep quality, and stress levels.

Phase 4: Analysis and Reporting (1 week, till December 30th, 2024)
Week 15: Analyze data using statistical methods. Prepare and submit reports to stakeholders.


Data Collection

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (70%), Siyang Yu (30%)

For our data collection process, we will focus on measuring two key outcomes: sleep quality and decision-making accuracy and speed. To assess sleep quality, we will utilize data extracted from smartwatches worn by the firefighters during their sleep. This method allows for a non-intrusive recording of various sleep parameters and ensures accuracy. The smartwatches will track metrics such as duration of sleep, percentage of time of deep sleep, heart rate, and restfulness, providing a comprehensive overview of the firefighters‚Äô sleep quality. This data will be collected for both the control and treatment groups, enabling a thorough comparison between them.

To gauge decision accuracy, we will invite senior police officers and fire managers to evaluate the participants‚Äô response accuracy. They will use a rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater accuracy. For measuring reaction time, the time taken by participants to respond to specific scenarios will be recorded using a stopwatch, with the measurements being captured in seconds. This dual-metric approach allows us to comprehensively assess both the quality and speed of decision-making among the firefighter participants.
Variables

Authors (Names and Percentages): Yuxuan Zhao (100%)
Outcomes (Dependent Variables):

    Decision-making accuracy
    Decision-making reaction time
    Sleep Quality
    Stress Level

Treatments (Independent Variables):

    Two months of mindfulness meditation training

Other Variables:

    Age
    Working experience( length of working)
    Gender
    Physical health conditions (fair / poor)
    Mental health history (problems of sleep loss occurred before? (Yes/ No)
    Marital status

Statistical Analysis Plan

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (100%)

Research Question 1: Decision-Making Accuracy
Statistical Method: Two-sample, One-sided t-test.
Dependent Variable (DV): Decision-making accuracy under stress score scaling from 0 to 10

This test is ideal for comparing the means of treatment and control groups firefighters practicing mindfulness meditation vs. those who do not. Given that decision-making accuracy is a continuous variable, the t-test will efficiently test the hypothesis of whether there is a significant difference in mean accuracy between the two groups.

Research Question 2: Decision-Making Reaction Time
Statistical Method: Two-sample, One-sided t-test.
Dependent Variable (DV): Reaction time under stress, record by time watch.

Rationale: Since reaction time is a continuous variable, a two-sample t-test is appropriate to compare the mean reaction times of treatment and control groups. This method will assess if the mindfulness meditation program leads to a statistically significant improvement in reaction time.

Research Question 3: Sleep Quality
Statistical Method: Two-sample, One-sided t-test.
Dependent Variable (DV): Sleep quality scores, continuous score based on sleep metrics.

Rationale: As with the previous variables, sleep quality scores are continuous and will be compared between treatment and control groups. The two-sample t-test is suitable for testing if there is a significant difference in mean sleep quality scores between those who practice mindfulness meditation and those who do not.
Sample Size

Authors (Names and Percentages): Benjamin Tan (80%), Siyang Yu (20%)
Sampling Methodology: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be employed to ensure the robustness of the findings. Firefighters who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the treatment group (mindfulness meditation) or the control group (no treatment or alternative treatment such as standard stress management training).

Once the sampling pool has been established, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two cohorts. (1) Treatment: Participants in this cohort will undergo a structured mindfulness meditation program, and (2) Control: Participants in this cohort will continue with their usual routines, and may receive an alternative treatment if deemed necessary to maintain ethical standards of research.

The sample size is determined by using the sample size formula: These are approximate because they are based on the normal distribution rather than the t distribution. Since œÉ and Œ¥ are not known exactly, the additional error added by using the normal distribution is not important unless the sample sizes are very small.

n=(ZŒ±/2+ZŒ≤Œ¥/œÉ)2
n=(1.96+1.280.05/0.52)2

n=2274

Description:
- n
is the sample size needed per group.
- ZŒ±/2 is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% confidence level, so ZŒ±/2 is approximately 1.96).
- ZŒ≤ is the Z-score corresponding to the desired power (90% power, so ZŒ≤ is approximately 1.28).
- Œ¥ is the expected difference in means (effect size) (Œ¥ is chosen as approximately 5%, i.e. 0.05).
- œÉ is the standard deviation of the outcome measure (œÉ

is chosen to be 0.52 based on a similar research study done).
Possible Recommendations

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (50%), Siyang Yu (50%)

Scenario 1: Null Hypothesis Not Rejected
If the study does not find significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis, it suggests that mindfulness meditation may not have a measurable impact on decision-making accuracy or sleep quality in emergency responders compared to the control group. In this case, we recommend broadening the scope of research to explore other potential interventions and strategies that could effectively enhance decision-making capabilities and sleep quality in emergency responders. This could include different types of stress management techniques, physical wellness programs, or cognitive-behavioral approaches. It‚Äôs important to note that the lack of observed effect in this study does not categorically rule out the benefits of mindfulness; it may still have subjective or unmeasured benefits. Further research could explore these aspects or different methodologies for mindfulness training.

Scenario 2: Null Hypothesis Rejected
If the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant positive impact of mindfulness meditation on decision-making and sleep quality among emergency responders, we advocate for the integration of mindfulness practices into their routine training and wellness programs. It will be important to develop a structured mindfulness meditation program tailored to the unique needs and schedules of emergency responders. This program should be designed to be easily accessible and feasible to implement within their existing work structure. Additionally, we recommend ongoing research to continuously evaluate and refine the mindfulness program, ensuring its effectiveness and alignment with the evolving needs of emergency responders.
Limitations

Authors (Names and Percentages): You Wu (50%), Yuxuan ZHao (50%)
Consistency in Participation
There is a chance that some participants might choose to discontinue their involvement in the mindfulness meditation and opt out of this experiment.

Individual variability
There are possibilities of individual variability in how responders experience and benefit from mindfulness meditation, which might contribute to inconsistent results.

Long-Term Sustainability
The study may not account for the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of mindfulness programs within the emergency response context, and the findings might not reflect how these practices evolve over time.

Ethical concerns
ethical concerns may occur during the meditation process, especially when considering the wellbeing of emergency responders and the potential risks associated with meditation, which may not be addressed in this research.

Short-Term Effects
The study might focus on short-term effects of mindfulness meditation, while the long-term impact may differ. Emergency responders‚Äô experiences with meditation may evolve over time.

Simulation Results for Research Questions

No effect scenario
Depending on our calculation above, the sample size (n) should be 4548 (2274*2). For research problem 1, we are setting the seed to 4172; for both the control group and the treatment group, the mean decision-making score is set to 6 and standard deviation is set to 1.87. The reference of setting the mean and standard deviation is from a similar study built to find the effect of making decisions from doing mindfulness meditation on both lower and higher stress levels‚Äô workers. (Bartlett et al., 2021)

For research problem 2, we are setting the seed to 4172; for both the control group and the treatment group, the mean decision-making time is set to 80 seconds, and standard deviation is set to 80 seconds. For reference found, the mean of decision-making time is set to be 80 seconds and standard deviation to be 40 seconds (Fire and EMS Department, n.d.).

For research problem 3, we are setting the seed to 4172; for both the control group and the treatment group, the mean deep-sleep percentage is set to 50% (0.5), and standard deviation is set to 0.1 (Rusch et al., n.d.). The reference of setting the proportion between the deep-sleep percentage and the standard deviation here is from a similar report aiming to test the effect of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality.

Have effect scenario
For the sample size (n) 4548 (2274x2), since the training for the treatment group need to be effected, we are still setting the seed to 4172 for research problem 1, the mean decision-making score for control group to 6 and standard deviation to 1.87; the mean decision-making score for treatment group to 6*103% (6.18) and standard deviation to 1.85.

For research problem 2, we are setting the seed to 4172; for the control group, the mean decision-making time is set to 80 seconds, and standard deviation is set to 80 seconds; for the control group, the mean decision-making time is set to 78.4 seconds, and standard deviation is set to 10.

For research problem 3, we are setting the seed to 4172; for the control group, the mean deep-sleep percentage is set to 50% (0.5), and standard deviation is set to 0.1; for the treatment group, the mean deep-sleep percentage is set to 50%*105% (0.525), and standard deviation is set to 0.09.
